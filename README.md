# Styleguide

Light-weight CSS framework for generating your own KSS documentation.

[Docs/Demo](http://www.tylerchilds.com/styleguide/docs/) (as generated by this repository)

### Features

## Installation

To use the CSS as is (a basic base stylesheet), you can install using bower:

```
bower install styleguide
```

If you want to create your own styleguide, fork the repository and modify the `src` and `kss-html` folders.

### Development

You'll need npm, bower and kss-node installed (`npm install -g kss`).

After cloning, just run `npm install && bower install && gulp`.

KSS will generate the docs from the `kss-html` folder. The `dist` folder is created from  the `src` folder.

### Contributors

Contributors are welcome, just follow these few guidelines:

* BEM for naming conventions
* Alphabetical properties
* Only nest for psuedo-elements
